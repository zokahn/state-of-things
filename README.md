# Project Notes API

This is a FastAPI-based API for managing project notes, tasks, issues, and related information.

## Current Status

- Implemented CRUD operations for all entities: Project, Task, Issue, DesignRule, Requirement, ProjectGoal, and SBOM
- Database tables for all entities have been created
- Basic API functionality is in place

## Features

- CRUD operations for Projects, Tasks, Issues, Design Rules, Requirements, Project Goals, and SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions
- Pydantic models for request/response validation

## Recent Accomplishments

1. Installed required packages: fastapi, sqlalchemy, pydantic, and requests
2. Fixed syntax issues in project_notes_client.py
3. Added proper docstrings and type hints to project_notes_client.py
4. Updated main.py with proper docstrings, type hints, and fixed import issues
5. Updated models.py with proper docstrings and added a __repr__ method

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up the database (instructions to be added)
4. Run the application: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## API Endpoints

- `/projects/`: Manage projects
- `/tasks/`: Manage tasks
- `/issues/`: Manage issues
- `/design_rules/`: Manage design rules
- `/requirements/`: Manage requirements
- `/project_goals/`: Manage project goals
- `/sboms/`: Manage Software Bill of Materials

For detailed API documentation, run the server and visit `/docs` endpoint.

## Immediate Tasks

1. Complete the update of schemas.py
2. Run a final lint check to ensure all issues are resolved
3. Test the API endpoints to ensure everything is working as expected

## Next Steps

- Test all implemented routes to ensure they're working correctly
- Implement relationships between entities (e.g., Tasks belonging to Projects)
- Add proper error handling and input validation for all routes
- Create a basic front-end interface to interact with the API
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement advanced queries (e.g., filtering, sorting)

## Mid-term Goals

- Optimize database queries and API performance
- Implement additional features like task assignment and project status updates
- Develop a comprehensive test suite

## Long-term Goals

- Add advanced features like reporting and analytics
- Deploy the application to a production environment
- Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
