# Project Notes API - Current State


## Recent Updates (as of 2024-08-19)

1. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling for all routes in main.py.
   - Added a log_input_validation decorator to log input data for all routes.
   - Implemented try-except blocks to catch and handle different types of errors (SQLAlchemyError, HTTPException, and general Exception).
   - Added appropriate logging statements for successful operations, warnings, and errors.

2. Documentation:
   - Updated README.md with information about the new error handling and logging implementation.
   - Added a new section in README.md specifically for Error Handling and Logging.
   - Updated the 'Recent Accomplishments' and 'Immediate Tasks' sections in README.md.

3. Project Status:
   - All routes (projects, tasks, issues, design_rules, requirements, project_goals, and sboms) now have proper error handling and logging.
   - The API is now more robust and easier to debug due to improved error handling and logging.

## Next Steps

1. Test all implemented routes to ensure they're working correctly with the new error handling.
2. Update and expand test coverage to include error scenarios.
3. Implement relationships between entities (e.g., Tasks belonging to Projects).
4. Create a basic front-end interface to interact with the API.
5. Add authentication and authorization.
6. Implement advanced queries (e.g., filtering, sorting).

## Mid-term Goals

- Optimize database queries and API performance.
- Implement additional features like task assignment and project status updates.
- Develop a comprehensive test suite.

## Long-term Goals

- Add advanced features like reporting and analytics.
- Deploy the application to a production environment.
- Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
- Implement advanced security features.
- Develop a mobile application for the API.
- Integrate with popular project management tools.
